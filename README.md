Goalkeeping is an app that helps you keep track of short and longterm goals. The app uses tableViewController to show the goals added by the user and keeps track of the progress.GoalKeeping has three view controllers: The main view controller that has the table view, The view controller to add the goal description and the view controller to add the number of days to complete the goal.

The app uses Core Data to store data persistently, and implements actions such as delete and add progress to table view rows. Persistence storage is one of the key features of the app.
